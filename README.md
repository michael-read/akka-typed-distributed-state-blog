#How To Distribute Application State with Akka Cluster

Building, testing, containerizing, deploying, and monitoring distributed microservices is difficult, but using Lightbend technologies can make it a lot faster and easier to be successful.
In this four part blog series, we walk you through a working Proof of Concept (PoC) built using Lightbend’s open source distributed toolkit, Akka. This PoC delivers a resilient, highly performant, elastic, distributed, and consistent state solution that provides an automatic in memory cache with a persistent backing. Here is the breakdown:
- [Part 1](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/how-to-distribute-application-state-with-akka-cluster-part-1-getting-started) - Getting Started: we walk through building, testing, and running the PoC locally, with instrumentation and monitoring wired in from the very beginning using Lightbend Telemetry. 
- [Part 2](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/how-to-distribute-application-state-with-akka-cluster-part-2-docker-and-local-deploy) - Docker and Local Deploy: here we cover containerizing our PoC, and then deploying locally in Docker. Then, we’ll load test and monitor our PoC as we did in the first installment.
- [Part 3](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/how-to-distribute-application-state-with-akka-cluster-part-3-kubernetes-monitoring) - Kubernetes and Monitoring: in this part,we introduce Lightbend Console for Kubernetes (K8s), and then deploy our PoC in Minikube (desktop version of K8s) using YAML files provided in this repository. Again, we’ll load test with Gatling, but this time we’ll monitor our PoC in Lightbend Console.
- Part 4 - Source Code: In our final installment, we do a deep dive into our Scala source code.
